# To-do list

This project is my first dabbling with React JS, an attempt to make my very own to-do list.

Update(4/1/2023): 
1.added bulleting for a better look

Update(5/1/2023):
1.added the option to submit by clicking "Enter"
2.removed the option to submit empty inputs and a "locked" cursor, which appears above the "Add" button when the input is empty(the button is disabled)
3.added the "pointer" cursor when it's above the tasks

Update(8/1/2023):
Had an issue with the line through going through the delete button as well. In order to fix that, i added a brand new button specifically for that purpose, which also matches the colour scheme of the app better and provided the much needed solution to my problem.

Update(9/1/2023):
Made the delete button appear always, not just when a task is crossed out.

Update(4/3/2023):
Had the idea to improve the looks of my list by adding a new font, which i imported from Google Fonts, as well as to increase the size a bit, so that the list itself is more visible and looks better.
